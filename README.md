What It Does-
EduFocus is a website/app/algorithm-based platform that aims to improve students' engagement and concentration during online lectures. Using realtime questioning, teachers can ask all the students in their class specfic questions after discussing certain topics in order to assess how well the class understood some material. Using python algorithms and OpenCV, EduFocus can also analyze the attentiveness of a student from their webcam.

How I Built It-
Website ( html, css, js ), Android App- ( Java, XML ), Algorithms/Database- ( Python, Firebase )
